# UROPS 2021 Topological Data Analysis

## Project Title: Persistent Homology of High-Dimensional Point Clouds
 

## Objective: 

The aim of the project is to investigate the effectiveness of applying methods in the emerging field of topological data analysis to solve problems that involve high-dimensional neural data. We will study the state-of-the-art method of persistent homology and several notable applications in computational neuroscience.

 
## Potential list of deliverables: 

Literature review detailing the current state of research and the open problems 

A study report explaining the theoretical foundations of topological data analysis 

A study report explaining the other pre-requisite knowledge 

Code for relevant implementations or proposed approach/solution to the problem identified 

A final report and/or presentation detailing the topics learned and findings 
 

## Sturcture of the project:

There are two parts to the project. First, we study the mathematical foundations of the state-of-the-art methods in topological data analysis. 
We then implement the method to discover topological features of high-dimensional neural data. 
 

## Timeline of the project:

1. Select topic  

Milestone: write up project proposal 

 
2. Conduct literature Review 

Milestone: write up report summarizing previous research and an overview of the pre-requisites 

 
3. Study the basics of Topological Data Analysis 

Milestone: write up report explaining the theories and/or techniques 


4. Study relevant applications of topology in computational neuroscience

Milestone: write up report explaining the theories and/or techniques 

(Finish the remaining pre-requisite knowledge, if any. Try to identify some problems/approaches for discussion in Week 7.) 

 

5. Define a problem and propose some possible approach(es).  

Milestone: write up a tentative abstract 

 

6. Implement preliminary experiments, with help from the code and tutorials available online.  

Milestone: potentially some code and/or solutions for subproblems 

 

7. Reformulate and evaluate the proposed problem/approaches and the direction of the research.  

Milestone: write up a report for the findings/discussion 

 

8. Continue with the experiment. / Study relevant theories (if we realize that more theories are needed to understand/solve the problem) 

Milestone: potentially some code and/or solutions for subproblems 

 

9. Conclude the project and summarize the findings.  

Milestone: a final report and a presentation (including topics learned, experiments/implementations, findings, and discussions) 
 

Relevance: 
The field of topological Data Analysis has been growing rapidly in the recent two decades since its emergence. However, research in investigating its effectiveness when applied to natural language data presents several interesting open problems. The work by Savle et al. confirmed the ability of topological features to effectively capture certain structural properties of discourse text. However, they acknowledged in the conclusion that “why exactly topological methods work on entailment is an open problem.” Michel et al. concluded contradictory results that topology-based document representations perform worse than simple techniques like tf-idf. We hope to take this uncertainty as a departure point for our investigation into the relevant existing topological methods and models for natural language data and their effectiveness.
