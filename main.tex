Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a recent field that emerged from various works in applied (algebraic) topology and computational geometry. 
The aim of TDA is to extract and analyze relevant topological and geometric features of real-world data, which are often high-dimensional and have complex underlying geometric structures. 

Our project is motivated by the question: how can high-dimensional point clouds be compared based on their topological structures? 
To this end, we proposed an approach to compare point clouds based on the $p$-Wasserstein distance of their topological fingerprints. 
We illustrated the approach with a concrete application in studying the neural population responses to different stimuli, each of which is represented as a high-dimensional point cloud. Our approach allowed us to quantify the pairwise similarity of the neural population responses in terms of their topological structures.
Using this approach, we also compared the topological structure of the point cloud associated with each neural population response with that of synthetic data sampled from $2$-sphere and torus.
